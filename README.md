# Linear Regression Project 📊

Welcome to our Linear Regression Machine Learning Project! This project utilizes Python along with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and StatsModels to perform linear regression analysis.

## Overview ℹ️

Linear regression is a fundamental technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we will use various Python libraries to perform linear regression analysis on a dataset.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
